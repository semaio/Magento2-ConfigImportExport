# ConfigImportExport

This extension provides CLI commands for Magento 2 to import/export system configuration data. 

## Why this extension?

While Magento 2 offers the `app:config:dump` / `app:config:import` commands, they're limited to one environment and a little bit hard to manage, especially in CI/CD setups. 

This extension supports managing configuration values for multiple environments (production, staging, etc.) out-of-the-box, defining and overwriting base configuration values in a specific environment. It also allows different file formats (e.g., YAML, JSON). In general, it makes that process a bit more streamlined and easier to manage, with the added benefit of generalization and cross-compatibility with other agencies/merchants using this.


## Installation

**Add the package to your composer.json**

```bash
composer require semaio/magento2-configimportexport

```


## Facts

* Supported PHP versions are 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.1.


## Functionality

This module is a work in progress and will be extended in the future with more functionality and support for other file formats.


### File formats

This module currently supports the following file formats:

* YAML (default)
* JSON

See [docs/file-formats.md](docs/file-formats.md) for more information and examples.


### Import config data

See [docs/config-import.md](docs/config-import.md) for more information.


### Export config data

See [docs/config-export.md](docs/config-export.md) for more information.

## Usage with Deployer

When using a push approach in CI/CD, the environment variables should be replaced on the runner and not on the initiating host or target host. For this, you can use this Deployer task to do this and import the config settings;

```
task('magento:config:set', function () {
    $resolver = new \Semaio\ConfigImportExport\Model\Resolver\EnvironmentVariableResolver();
    $glob = glob('config/store/**/*.yaml');
    array_walk($glob, function ($file) use ($resolver) {
        if (file_put_contents($tempFile = tempnam('/tmp', get('clientslug')), $resolver->resolveValue(file_get_contents($file)))) {
            upload($tempFile, get('release_path') . '/' . $file);
        }
    });
    run('{{bin/php}} {{release_path}}/bin/magento config:data:import {{release_path}}/config/store ' . get('environment'));
});
```
